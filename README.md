Hi, I'm Afna Ayshu Jaffin, a third-year CSE student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree. As a tech enthusiast, I have participated in several hackathons, gaining hands-on experience in software development. Recently, I received a special mention for my participation in GDG Cloud Kochi's AI Adapt Search competition on Kaggle, which further fueled my interest in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition, I'm currently taking a course on Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which has given me a deeper understanding of how technology can be leveraged to streamline business processes. With a good understanding of programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, and a growing proficiency in RPA, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and take on exciting projects. Connect with me to explore innovative solutions and collaborate on exciting projects!
